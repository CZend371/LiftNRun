Using React.JS this application can log workouts and runs for the user. It will record run time and distance and show you the route taken using Google Maps Javascript API. The user can also select to do cardio from the app and record their time and anything else the user deems essential. The user just fills in the forms for weightlifting in order to record the data and then using MongoDB and Mongoose it allows the data to be stored and retrieved if the user wants to see previous workouts. In order to use the app the user must sign up/login and it is ready to go! Just choose the type of workout and record! This is a one of a kind application as no one else on the market currently lets you record a run and a gym workout in one app.
